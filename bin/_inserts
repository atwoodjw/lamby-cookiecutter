# Much like Heroku, most Rails applications can serve static
# assets without the complexity of an S3-backed asset host.
# The later is recommended as your site grows since it maintains
# old files (like images) to always be present at the origin.
# This addition to production environment file will allow Lamby
# to service static assets that are Base64 encoded with cache
# control headers like max-age set. This addition also sets:
#
# - Enables the Lograge gem to reduce CloudWatch noise/costs.
# - Lograge's initializer uses JSON for CloudWatch Logs INSIGHTS.

# Few additions to .gitignore for:
#
# - SAM's `.aws-sam` build dir.
# - Encourage Dotenv best practices. Ex: Use `.env.development.local`.
# - Lamby leverages Docker and we build gems into `/vendor/bundle-dev`
